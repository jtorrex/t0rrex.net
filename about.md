I'm just another curious person interested on projects based for *nix environments, so I don't consider myself as an expert, but for now I'm enjoying taking a look on all that seems interesting for me.

## Currently

I've been working for the last year and a few months on a research center as a Systems Administrator. We take care about the diferent services offered on the center also the HPC machines that brings compute resources to the community.

### Specialized in

Nothing at all, but I'm very interested on virtualization resources and forms to automate the process to deploy and maintain IT infrastructure.

In this section there is a list with diferent technologies where sometimes I putted my hands dirty playing with it.
